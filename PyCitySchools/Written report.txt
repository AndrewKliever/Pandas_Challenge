Written report

1.small to medium sized schools by student population have a higher passing average in both math and reading.
2.charter schools have a higher passing percentage of students than district schools even though the spending range per student is similar 

the conclusion i draw from this information is charter schools are able to give more attention to their students due to smaller class sizes or have a better curriculum resulting in a better education than district school. the amount of money per student does not seem to have a correlation between passing rates either, indicating the resources are not the issue either. further supporting that class size has a larger effect on grades than school funding.
