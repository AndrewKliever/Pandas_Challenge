written review


3 observations for the data:

1. a definitive answer of if these 4 drugs are affective against cancer based on the data is inconclusive. 
i feel a control group with out drugs should have been monitored as well

2. of the drugs tested capomulin did seem to have positive effects in combating the cancer as there was a steady decrease in tumor volume over the whole monitored timeframe. 

3. a positive correlation between weight of the mouse and the size of the tumor was observed for capomulin as well indicating there is a undefined variable or condition with the drug that either causes the mouse to gain weight, causing tumor size increase, or mice with any conditions that influence weight gain have a negative affect to the treatment.
